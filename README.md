### What is RISC-V Toolchain?
> The RISC-V toolchain comprises the assembler, compiler, linker, and debugger, each playing a critical role in developing and debugging software for RISC-V microcontrollers. Understanding how these components work together empowers developers to write efficient code, leverage existing libraries, and debug their applications effectively. By harnessing the power of the RISC-V toolchain, developers can unlock the full potential of this open-source instruction set architecture.
